**Accurate as of 01/10/23**
An Analysis of Dominance in Formula 1 Across the Years

Red Bull Racing are currently the kings of F1, winning both championships this year in dominating fashion. There is no doubt this team is one of the greats, but how great are they really? Here is a short personal data analysis project I did comparing the performances of Red Bull(2023) to other dominant F1 teams from the past, including Mercedes(2015), Ferrari(2002) & McLaren(1988).

The data is sourced from the Ergast API (http://ergast.com/mrd).

# Skills I developed/improved through this project:
### Data Collection & Processing
- Collected data from each season's race & qualifying results and saved in .csv files
- Cleaned and processed the data to make it usable

### Analysis
- Conducted exploratory analysis using Python
- Calculated relevant statistics for comparison between different datasets

### Visualization & Reporting
- Utilized PowerBI for effective data visualization of the results
- Compiled and wrote a comprehensive final report, available in the `docs` directory


This was a very interesting project with results that may be surprising to younger or more casual fans of the sport. This project served as a great experience for me to hone my data processing, analysis and visualisations skills. I look forward to sharing more interesting projects in the future :)
