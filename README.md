# How-Dominant-Are-Red-Bull-Really
An Analysis of Dominance in Formula 1 Across the Years

Red Bull Racing are currently the kings of F1, winning both championships this year in dominating fashion. There is no doubt this team is one of the greats, but how great are they really? Here is a short personal data analysis project I did comparing the performances of Red Bull(2023) to other dominant F1 teams from the past, including Mercedes(2015), Ferrari(2002) & McLaren(1988).

The data is sourced from the Ergast API (http://ergast.com/mrd).
In this project I:
    Collected data from each season's race & qualifying results in .csv files
    Cleaned the data to make it usable
    Did some exploratory analysis in Python
    Calculated relevant statistics for comparison
    Used PowerBI to visualise the results
    Wrote a final report in docs

This was a very interesting project with results that may be surprising to younger or more casual fans of the sport. This project served as a great experience for me to hone my data processing, analysis and visualisations skills. I look forward to sharing more interesting projects in the future :)
